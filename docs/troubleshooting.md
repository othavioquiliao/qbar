# Troubleshooting

## Decide Which Layer Owns The Problem

| Symptom                                 | Likely owner              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Provider auth/login failure             | `qbar`                    |
| Cache looks stale                       | `qbar`                    |
| `qbar status` fails in a terminal       | `qbar`                    |
| Waybar parser error after setup/apply   | Live Waybar config/style  |
| Waybar module missing from the live bar | Live Waybar config wiring |

## qbar Runtime Checks

```bash
qbar status --refresh
qbar --provider claude
qbar --provider codex
qbar --provider amp
```

If these fail outside Waybar, the issue is in `qbar` or provider auth.

## Common Cases

### `qbar setup` finished but nothing appeared in Waybar

Run:

```bash
qbar apply-local
```

Then reload Waybar manually if needed: `pkill -SIGUSR2 waybar`.

### Waybar fails after manual CSS edits

Waybar uses GTK CSS, not browser CSS. Avoid unsupported constructs in manual integration, especially web-style variables and pseudo-selectors that GTK rejects.

To reset qbar-managed style wiring:

```bash
qbar apply-local
```

### Provider order looks wrong

`qbar` normalizes `waybar.providers` and `waybar.providerOrder` in `~/.config/qbar/settings.json`. Unsupported providers are dropped and missing enabled providers are appended.

### Amp is missing or right-click does not start Amp login

The Amp flow now expects the official installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ampcode.com/install.sh | bash
```

After install, run `amp login` or right-click the Amp module again. If Waybar still looks stale, reload it manually with `pkill -SIGUSR2 waybar`.

### Uninstall removed qbar but Waybar still references qbar modules

Run forced cleanup:

```bash
qbar remove
```
