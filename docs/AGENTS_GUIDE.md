# Agents Guide

This project supports two install flows. Choose one:

- Manual copy: `docs/SETUP_MANUAL.md`
- Symlink setup: `docs/SETUP_SYMLINK.md`

## Safety
- Do not overwrite user config without backup
- Show diffs before editing Waybar config/CSS
- Never run installers unless user asks

## Validate
Run:
```bash
~/.config/waybar/scripts/waybar-llm-usage.sh
```
